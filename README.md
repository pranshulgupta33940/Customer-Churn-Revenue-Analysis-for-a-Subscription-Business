> **Predict customer attrition risk and generate AI-driven retention strategies.**

## 📄 Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end Machine Learning solution designed to predict customer churn for a subscription-based telecom company. By analyzing customer demographics, service usage, and billing patterns, the model identifies "at-risk" customers before they leave.

The solution is deployed as an interactive **Streamlit Web Application** that empowers business teams to:
-  **Visualize** individual customer profiles.
-  **Predict** churn probability in real-time.
-  **Receive** actionable retention recommendations (e.g., specific discounts).

---

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Machine Learning Model**: optimizing for Release (finding actual churners) using a **Random Forest Classifier** (~68% Recall/Accuracy).
- **Interactive Dashboard**: A professional Dark Mode UI built with Streamlit.
- **Explainable AI**: Integrated **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** values to show *why* a customer is at risk.
- **Synthetic Data Pipeline**: Custom script (`generate_data.py`) to generate realistic Telco datasets.
- **Containerized**: Docker support for consistent deployment.

## 📊 Model Performance
To ensure realistic performance in a noisy customer behavior environment, we prioritized robust generalization over synthetic perfection. 

- **Algorithm**: Random Forest Classifier
- **Accuracy**: ~68%
- **Recall**: ~68% (Key metric: prioritizing catching potential churners)

> *Note: Unlike theoretical projects with 99% accuracy, this model uses realistic noise simulation to mimic actual business data challenges.*

## � Exploratory Data Analysis Structure
Here are some insights derived from the dataset:

| Churn Distribution | Contract Type Analysis |
| :---: | :---: |
| ![Churn Distribution](plots/churn_distribution.png) | ![Churn by Contract](plots/churn_by_contract.png) |

**Key Findings:**
*   **Contract Sensitivity**: Users with *Month-to-month* contracts are significantly more likely to churn.
*   **Tenure Impact**: Newer customers (0-12 months) are at the highest risk.
